## 🧠 What I do (in one sentence)
I turn lead-generation operations into a **data-driven, automated, AI-assisted engine** — from ads optimization → tracking → reporting → stakeholder visibility.

---

## 🚀 Current focus (AI-Driven Marketing)
- **Performance Marketing**: Google Ads / Meta Ads · CPL/CPA optimization · funnel performance management  
- **Growth Analytics**: KPI frameworks · cohort/funnel analysis · weekly/monthly executive reporting  
- **AI-in-Workflow**: prompt patterns for ops, analysis, reporting, content QA · decision support from structured outputs  
- **Automation**: Google Sheets / Apps Script / Make.com (workflow & data sync) · alerting & monitoring  
- **Stakeholder-ready output**: dashboards, one-pagers, clean narratives for cross-functional alignment

---

## 🛠️ Web Development & Tool Building
I build lightweight tools that improve execution speed, data clarity, and decision quality:
- **Internal tools**: trackers, monitoring dashboards, calculators, checklists, playbooks
- **Web tooling**: landing/corp microsites, interactive components, data-driven UI
- **Integration mindset**: connect ads data → sheets → dashboards → notifications → reporting

---

## 📌 Signature strengths
- **Numbers-first marketing**: ROI logic, experimentation, and accountability
- **Systems thinking**: reduce manual workload, increase transparency, stabilize operations
- **Execution + visibility**: results that can be defended in meetings and shown in dashboards
